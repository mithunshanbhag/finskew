# APP CHECKLIST

This is my opinionated checklist for building indie-SaaS, micro-SaaS apps. It is not exhaustive, but it covers some important aspects of my app building process. This is a living document and will be updated / tweaked as required.

## Preferred tech stack

My preferred framework for building apps is .NET (currently .NET 10 is the latest version):

- Frontend: Blazor WebAssembly (with MudBlazor controls).
- Backend: Azure Function Apps.
- Database: Azure Cosmos DB (NOSQL API, formerly known as Core SQL API).

I prefer to host my apps and related infra on Azure using serverless/PaaS. This is to keep things relatively simple, low maintenance and low cost.

## Steps

### Step 1 - Requirements

### Step 2 - Mockups

### Step 3 - Implementation

### Step 4 - Testing

### Step 5 - Deployment

### Step 6 - Monitoring

### Step 7 - User Feedback and Improvement

### Step 8 - Maintenance and Iteration

## Cross cutting concerns
