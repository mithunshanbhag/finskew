  - Status badges (e.g., build status, test coverage) at the top. You can use placeholders if none exist.
  - A screenshot or GIF demonstrating the project in action. You can use a placeholder if none exist.
  - An installation instructions section with clear steps on how to install the project.
  - A usage instructions section that explains how to use the project.
  - A section on how to build and run the project locally, with clear instructions.
  - A section on how to run the tests, with clear instructions.
