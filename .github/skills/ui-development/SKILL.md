- To the greatest extent possible, try to use built-in the defined themes, styles, typography, color palettes, and components from MudBlazor when implementing the UI in Blazor. This will help maintain a consistent look and feel across the app and also speed up development. Try to avoid custom CSS and styles unless absolutely necessary.
